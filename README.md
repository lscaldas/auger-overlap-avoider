# auger-overlap-avoider

Welcome to Auger Overlap Avoider! This software helps you determine the kinetic energies suitable for measuring your XPS data, while avoiding the risk of overlapping with Auger peaks. <br> 

## How to run 

1) Download the zip file from the repository.
2) Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your system.
3) Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system.
4) Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents.
5) Install the required dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt 
6) Run the program by typing the following command: python auger_overlap_avoider_vxx.py, replacing vxx with the current version of the program:  <br>
