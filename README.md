# auger-overlap-avoider

Software to determine the kinetic energies that you can use to measure your XPS data, without the risk of overlapping with Auger peaks.<br> 

## How to run 

1) Download the zip file
2) Extract it
3) Having python and pip installed in your system, run the following code:
4) pip install -r requirements.txt (in a command prompt inside the folder you extracted.)
5) Run the program by typing: python auger_overlap_avoider_vxx.py (in a command prompt inside the folder you extracted. Replace vxx with the current version of the program.  <br>

6) Follow the instructions for the input boxes and press ok to have a list of allowed kinetic energy ranges and the Auger peaks that you should avoid when measuring your XPS peaks.<br>
